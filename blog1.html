    <h2>What Is Markdown?</h2>
    <p>Markdown is a plain text to html conversion tool aimed at making writing for the internet easier.The main philosophy behind markdown is that it allows to write in easier to read easier to write plain text format and then convert it structutrally into valid html.
   </p> <hr>
   <h2>Why to use Markdown?</h2>
   <h3>It converts to HTML easily</h3>
    <p>Now, if you’re going to be writing something into HTML, you should write HTML. But if you’re, say, writing an email or a readme file where you need HTML’s formatting options but not all of its features, Markdown is perfect in order to write same in HTML you have to learn its syntax,the hassle of opening and closing tag plus html in itself is a very vast which comes with its own learning curve so if you are a beginner and you haven't used HTMl before it can be overwhelming when you just want to write  an email or a readme file or you just want to bold a text or highlight something or maybe just adding bullets in list.
   </p><p> Markdown is everywhere. Websites like Reddit and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based applications too supports Markdown. </p>
<hr><h2>How to write Markdown syntax?</h2>
<p>let’s learn a few basic formatting techniques that will help you to get started with Markdown.
</p> 
<h3>1.Headings</h3>
   <p> Any line which is prefixed with a # symbol is converted into a heading. The number of hashes indicates the level of the heading. For example: one hash is converted to an h1 heading, two hashes to an h2 and so on (till h6).
    
    <br> # This is an h1 heading <br>
    
    ## This is an h2 heading <br>
    
    <h3>2. Emphasis</h3>
    <p>If you want to put emphasis on a word, make use of asterisk symbol. Single asterisk will italicize the text and a double asterisk will make the word bold. <br>
    
    *This text will be italic* <br>
    
    **This text will be bold** </p>
    
    <h3>3. Lists</h3>
   
    <p> For a bullet (unordered) list in Markdown, just prefix each word with an asterisk.
    
    <br> *this is a list <br>
    
    *bread <br>
    
    *butter <br>
    
    For a numbered (ordered) list, just put numbers instead of an asterisk.
