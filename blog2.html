<h2>Things to remember</h2>
<ul><li> Start Early- So that you are able to submit draft proposals, before you submit the final one. Generally the projects, require some industrial tools for project management hence getting in touch with project mentors early and discussing these details in the beginning and putting the details about the same in the proposal will help you out.
    <li>Learn to minimize- You should know your priorities, don’t just run after all the projects,don’t aim for projects which you wont be able to handle.
        <li>Your proposal must contain -
            <li>A well written summary of your project</li>
            <li>A detailed description of the problem, you want to solve</li>
            <li>Description of any feature which you would like to add</li>
            <li>Include any work experience or project you have worked on in the past</li>
            <li>Write your vision for the project</li></ul>
